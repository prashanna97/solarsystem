            <h3>Sun</h3>
            <p>The Sun is the blazing heart of our solar system — a massive ball of glowing plasma that provides the energy necessary for life on Earth. Composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, it fuels itself through nuclear fusion, releasing light and heat that reaches millions of kilometers into space.Although it looks calm from afar, the Sun is a dynamic and violent sphere, constantly erupting with solar flares and magnetic storms. It contains 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system and its immense gravity keeps all the planets in orbit.In essence, the Sun is not just a star — it is the reason our solar system exists.</p>

            <h3>Mercury</h3>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun in our solar system. It completes an orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, making it the fastest-moving planet. Despite being nearest to the Sun, Mercury isn't the hottest planet; that distinction belongs to Venus due to its dense atmosphere. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, leading to extreme temperature fluctuations—from scorching highs of about 430°C (800°F) during the day to freezing lows of -180°C (-290°F) at night. The planet's surface is heavily cratered, resembling Earth's Moon, and it lacks any moons of its own. Notably, Mercury possesses a large metallic core, contributing to its status as the second densest planet in the solar system after Earth.</p>

            <h3>Venus</h3>
            <p>Venus, often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition, is the second planet from the Sun. It has a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures reaching up to 465°C (869°F). Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, which is longer than its year-long orbit around the Sun (225 Earth days). The planet's surface is dotted with volcanoes and vast plains, and it has no moons or rings. Despite its harsh conditions, Venus has been a target for numerous space missions due to its intriguing geology and atmospheric phenomena.</p>

            <h3>Earth</h3>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It has a diverse environment, with vast oceans covering about 71% of its surface, and a variety of ecosystems ranging from deserts to rainforests. Earth has a protective atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, which shields it from harmful solar radiation and helps regulate temperature. The planet's surface is dynamic, shaped by tectonic activity, erosion, and weathering. Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon, which influences tides and stabilizes the planet's axial tilt. Its unique combination of water, atmosphere, and suitable temperatures makes Earth a haven for life as we know it.</p>
